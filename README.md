## Getting started
If you'd like to learn how to use the engine to build a game, there's a completely free course in the [Skool community](https://www.skool.com/game-dev)

You can find all tutorials and resources for getting started within the community.

## Licensing
By default, the repository has an educational license that makes the engine free to use for personal projects.

[Educational license terms](https://github.com/alpinestudios/oogabooga/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

When you're ready to take the next step and work on a commercial game, you can upgrade to the full commercial license.

Here are the benefits of obtaining the full license:
- Permanent Ownership: You completely own the source code for life.
- No Recurring Fees or Royalties: Just an affordable one-time payment.

You can [book a call with Randy](https://calendly.com/tomrandy/30min) to find out more.
